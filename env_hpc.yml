  - defaults
dependencies:
  # --- Core Requirements ---
  - python=3.9        # Or specify the version you need
  - pip             # Include pip itself
  - pandas          # For data handling
  - numpy           # For numerical operations
  - scikit-learn    # For metrics, maybe preprocessing?
  - matplotlib      # For plotting (if automl.py saves plots)
  - seaborn         # For plotting (if automl.py saves plots)

  # --- ML Models ---
  - tensorflow      # Standard TensorFlow (conda will get dependencies)
  - xgboost         # XGBoost model
  # Add 'keras' here if your fnn/rnn/cnn models import it directly and it's not just tf.keras
  # - keras

  # --- Other potentially needed packages ---
  # Add ONLY if your automl.py script directly imports them
  # - jupyterlab  # If running notebooks within the env later
  # - ipykernel   # If using notebooks
  # - openpyxl    # If reading/writing excel files

  # --- Leave out low-level libs and macOS specifics ---
  # DO NOT add appnope, libgfortran, libcxx, etc.
  # DO NOT add build strings (=h... or =py...)
  # DO NOT add tensorflow-macos

  # --- Pip dependencies (ONLY if package is not on conda/conda-forge) ---
  # Only add things here if they truly cannot be installed via conda
  # - pip:
  #   - some-pip-only-package
